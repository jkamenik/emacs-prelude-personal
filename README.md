# Prelude Personal

These are my personal Prelude settings.  They are intended to be
installed in `~/.emacs.d/personal` after
[Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) is installed.

## Installation

Follow the Prelude install [guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude#installing-emacs-24)

```bash
$ curl -L https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh | sh
$ cd ~/.emacs.d
$ rm -rf personal
$ git clone git@github.com:jkamenik/emacs-prelude-personal.git personal
$ emacs
# M-x install-my-packages
